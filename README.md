# MVMod
COD4 Mod aimed at improving editability and modernization

NOT for playability or balance. Purely to smooth and refresh the experience of faking frags for MVM
---


Current features-

-Weapons curated for art style and editability. No guns that look terrifyingly weird in a COD4 edit

-Pezbot for testing/iw3xo usage
(I am planning on removing pezbots as I continue the mod. Ideally you should be able to drag and drop on top of pezbots if needed.)

-Custom (properly scaled) font + new XP animation - Not squished or stretched like most of the fonts on cfgfactory. Some letters get black-boxed though

Optional cfg for visual and gameplay tweaks

---

Planned features-

Texture overhaul for custom Weapons
(Specifically the BO1 AK/AK74U. The ports I used are quite weirdly textured)

Texture improvements around the base game. Specifically specularmaps that seem like they are too smooth.

Sound overhaul
(I believe that the soundscape of cod4 has become sort of an earsore due to insane familiarity. It should be refreshing to replace the soundscape -including ambience, weapons, and movement)

Improved animations for default weapons that don't get enough light in the editing scene

Menu and UI overhaul to refresh the experience of entering the game and experiencing it
